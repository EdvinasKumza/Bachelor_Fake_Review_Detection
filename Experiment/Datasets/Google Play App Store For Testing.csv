"Honestly the premium version is just not worth it, what's the point of having advanced calendar views and event setup and calendar import if, in every case, you can't see future recurring events? (The next event in the list of recurring appears only if you have ticked off the previous instance) In order to use a calendar efficiently for planning you ought to see what events are next, this hindrance has been made present by the users as far as 2015 (as I'm seeing online) and nothing has been done, that not only shows poor hindsight (what's a calendar without planning) but also a strikingly deaf customer service. The app is probably just as good as its free version, the pomodoro timer is ok, but the extra features are just not worth the expense for the premium version.",genuine

"Good thing it's free, else who would pay? As a fan of Microsoft products, the development of this app is disappointing. It's nothing but average. If the developers can just pick the top task management apps in the play store and add their features into this Todo app, perhaps the development could be accelerated.

Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either.",genuine

So down to 2 star and my suggestion to get the app to 5-stars would be if each input would automatically be visibly dated & if real time sync actually was real- time. Needed vital info and thought I could just check the note on my smart phone but, this has not been the case. Wasted a lot of my time & nothing.",genuine

"Autofailed tasks should be more intuitive. They don't actually fail until you visit your task list, and if you failed them yesterday the points for the day you failed them don't go to that day, they go to the current day. So because I slacked off yesterday, I'm starting today with like -20 gold on my chart! That's not fair and it skews the stats. If I didn't do something yesterday, I want it to show that I didn't do something /yesterday/. And when I autofail a task it should alert me with a notification, or at least as soon as I open it to the home screen. And tasks should be able to be set to just autofail at midnight without having to fiddle with the current more involved settings.",genuine

I really like this app I find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your EVENTS very useful. The one drawback for me is that it doesn't integrate with Google Tasks or Reminders. This means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event. This is not a massive deal but I do like the convenience of tasks over events. The widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time.,genuine

Now the customer service told me that I'm using a cheap device, when in fact it i m using a premium budget phone. Bulls**t customer service as well since they clearly can't take the blame like a real man/woman. Bunch of frauds n scammers tryna make their customer buy their failed invention. Go fu*k urself customer service! Good luck selling nud*s coz u failed it here!",genuine
"Extremely aggressive in pushing the premium and paid version. Also overly complex since as its name denotes, it tries to do everything or anything. It may be beneficial to consolidate and duplicate tasks of several other apps even though some can perform better. Compare the shopping list in Google Keep which is easier to add or subtract items from a constant shopping list. This app combining tasks from other apps can be useful, depending on an individual's preferences and abilities.",genuine

This app has some major problems. It seemed to work fine for the first day of running. After the first day no reminders were executed.

EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs.

Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.

"I was excited to use this app and love the categories and reward system for habits, dailies, to-do. After a few days and several rookie mistakes that aren't explained well in the tutorial, I realized this app is way too heavy on the game mechanics for my use. I want to have a list of dailies to partially complete everyday, to encourage reading and writing every now and then, not everyday. This app punishes you for not checking these things off everyday. I totally didn't realize my character was losing tons of health until it hit the red zone. I then started reading up on the death mechanic and am very turned off. I can understand wanting to give the players consequences for missing a task, but it shouldn't be health loss and it should account for how the player uses the dailies (must complete everyday or bonus if completed). They also do not make it easy to provide feedback. All the discussion links either required creating a separate account (different from the habatica account) or were closed threads. This app could be so fun but I feel it loses sight of promoting good habits/organization. I love gaming, but this is super heavy handed mechanics to me.

"Updated review: I have used this app for half a year, against my better judgement.  I have sent eighteen bug reports to the devs.  Little.  I could easily send another twenty more, but it isn't worth the time.  This is simply the most bugged piece of software I have ever used.  The avatars are hideous.  The only good thing that this app has going for it is the clean user interface, and a clever separation of the to-do list into three sections.  It is missing some pretty basic to-do list functionality.  The game loads slowly, and doesn't work without an internet connection.  Some of the bugs I've experienced: Reminders pop up on random days, no matter how many times I readjust their settings. Constantly having trouble connecting to the servers. Visual bugs: shows one item, but you get some other item.  Newly equipped main weapon won't show on avatar until app restarted. Progress bars for quests spaz out every time you open the page. Keyboards won't go away once they pop up. And the list goes on and on...",genuine

"Coordinates Humans 🙌🏾 This app was my go-to until covid hit. Keeping my personal, consulting business, and day work calendars in one app was madness. I broke off my day work to microsoft .to do on a separate device. Any.do now coordinates my consulting and my personal and family tasks, lists, and bills. Its refreshing. I do have syncing issues for calendar events as well as a crash everytime I add people to invites when creating an event. Thats why I gave it 4-stars. Love it for tasks.",genuine

Some apps, like bz pro, have the option where you can click on the reminder in the status bar to read it; or accidentally touch it; but the reminder won't disappear from the status bar until the user pushes a button to actively dismiss it.

When I get a new phone I wasn't able to transfer my account and discovered that the unpaid version has even fewer options available than before.",genuine

It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done.

I organized my entire week with this app—it made everything so simple!,fake

Edit: to have a daily reminder, I need to create a routine, set number of days (whatever that means) to 1, open it, add an activity, create a new tag for it (cause I can't just give it a simple name), then go back and enable the routine.

Even though I've removed all battery saving options on tick tick and also given it permission to autostart and run in background, this Pomo function still keeps malfunctioning. Kindly fix this issue.

"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?",genuine
